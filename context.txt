This software is  a simulation of a backend economic system consisting of one 
or many many cities that can trade together. Each city contains consumers, 
companies, a bank, a marketplace and a government that acts as agents in 
this simulation. Companies produces goods that sells in the marketplace to 
consumers at tha price that clears the market. Companies can also invest 
in upgrading their production facilities to become more efficient. The 
backendcode is written in c++ with data stored in an SQLite Database. The frontend (not in this repository) uses a number of APIs to interact with eh SQLite database to control the simulation. 

It is very important that you make changes in very small steps and testing them as often as possible. I also would like to work with Git/GitHub using issues and creating a new issue for all larger steps with a corresponding new brach for each issue. As the issue is tested and closed we commit to the main branch. Please remind me of this frequently.
